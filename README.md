# Mvc5SiteMapBuilder

Mvc5SiteMapBuilder is a tool that provides flexible menus, breadcrumb trails, similar to the ASP.NET SiteMapProvider model.
This code has been ported and adapted from project (https://github.com/maartenba/MvcSiteMapProvider) to meet specific needs of supporting DistributedCaching.
This code has various changes created to alter the original behavior and re-work the caching side of things.
